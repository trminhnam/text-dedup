This is the text of the message I preached at Lakes Entrance Uniting Church on Sunday 29th July 2018. It was the fifth in a series on the Gospel of Mark, and the second of two on Mark 6:1-13.

Mark 6:1-13 (NIV)

1 Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples. 2 When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed.
